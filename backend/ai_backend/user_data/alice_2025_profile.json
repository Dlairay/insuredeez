What kind of activities do you have planned? The more details you can give me, the better I can understand your needs and find the perfect policy for you.\n",

      "content": "Okay, Switzerland! That sounds amazing. To help me narrow down the best travel insurance options for you, could you tell me a bit more?\n\n*   **How long will you be in Switzerland?** (e.g., a week, two weeks, a month?)\n*   **When are you planning to travel?** (Approximate dates will do)\n*   **What kind of activities are you planning?** (e.g., hiking, skiing, sightseeing, business meetings?)\n*   **Are you travelling alone, with family, or with a group?**\n*   **Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions?**\n\nThe more information you give me, the better I can understand your potential needs and find the right policy for you. For example, if you're planning on doing a lot of hiking in the Alps, you'll want to make sure your insurance covers mountain activities. If you have a pre-existing condition, you'll need to ensure the policy covers that as well.\n",
