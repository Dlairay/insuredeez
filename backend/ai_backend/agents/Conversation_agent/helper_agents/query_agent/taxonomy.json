The insured person must prove that, at the time of suffering the loss, they were in no way directly or indirectly taking part in any of those activities, apart from steps which were reasonably necessary to protect themselves or their property. They must also not have been involved in controlling, preventing, suppressing or in any other way dealing or attempting to deal with those events.\n\nThis cover will not apply 30 days after the outbreak of war or any of the events listed during the insured person that country.\n\nIf the insured person is insured under more than one policy with us covering passive war extension, the most we will pay for all claims arising directly or indirectly from this will be limited to one policy only (with the highest limit on passive war extension).\n\nSECTION 50 HIJACK OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT\n\nIf the public transport in which the insured person is travelling is hijacked, we will pay for every full six hours in a row that they are prevented from reaching their scheduled destination.

What is covered If during a trip outside Singapore, the insured person suffers an acute onset of a pre-existing medical condition, we will extend the benefits under section 6 \u2013 Overseas medical expenses and section 16 \u2013 Emergency medical evacuation and repatriation to pay for the expenses incurred by the insured person up to 30 days from the date the insured person first suffers the acute onset of a pre-existing medical condition during the trip.

The limits shown below are sub-limits of the relevant sections extended and not above or in addition of the limits in each section.\n[Page 13] 9. To be eligible for cover under TravelEasy\u00ae Pre-Ex plans, the insured person must meet all the conditions stated under section 52 - Pre-Ex Critical Care. DEFINITION OF WORDS (Applicable to the whole policy) TERM DEFINITION Acute onset of a pre-existing medical condition Refers to a sudden, unexpected and rapid deterioration of the insured person\u2019s pre- existing medical condition resulting in a serious medical condition.\n[Page 21] The most we will pay under sections 6 (including extension under section 52 \u2013 Pre-Ex Critical Care) to section 11 in total, will not be more than the maximum limit under the section 6 \u2013 Overseas medical expenses.\n[Page 26] The maximum we will pay for all services and benefits under sections 16 (including extension under section 52\u2013 Pre-Ex Critical Care) to section 19 will not be more than $1,000,000 per insured person for any one journey, no matter how many events are involved. The limits for section 16 \u2013 Emergency medical evacuation and repatriation extended under section 52 \u2013 Pre-Ex Critical Care are sub-limits of this section.
