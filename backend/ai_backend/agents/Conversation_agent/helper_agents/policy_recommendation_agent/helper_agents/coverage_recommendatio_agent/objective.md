BLOCK 5: MSIG Proprietary Intelligence &
Predictive Recommendations
Data-Driven Product Recommendations
STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE: Use MSIG's historical claims data to provide specific product
recommendations during the quotation process, leveraging actual claim patterns to guide
customers to optimal coverage choices.
CLAIMS DATA INTELLIGENCE INTEGRATION
Core Capability: Integrate MSIG's proprietary claims database alongside the quotation process
to provide data-driven recommendations on which specific MSIG product tier and coverage
options best match the customer's extracted travel profile.
Implementation Approach: When the system generates quotes based on document
intelligence, it simultaneously analyzes MSIG's historical claims data to identify patterns
matching the customer's travel profile, destination, and activities, then recommends the most
appropriate product tier with supporting rationale.
Example : The LLM notice that at the destination, 80% of medical claims are above XXX Sgd →
It recommend to take the silver option where the limit for this benefits is YYY with YYY>XXX
HISTORICAL CLAIMS PATTERN ANALYSIS
Destination-Specific Recommendations:
Claim Frequency Analysis:
●
High-Risk Destinations: Locations with elevated medical claim frequencies recommend
comprehensive coverage tiers
Coverage Adequacy Assessment:
●
Limit Sufficiency: Historical claim amounts determine whether standard or enhanced
coverage limits are recommended
Product Tier Optimization:
Data-Driven Recommendations:
●
●
●
Basic Plan Suitability: Low-risk profiles matching successful basic plan claim patterns
receive appropriate tier recommendations
Standard Plan Indicators: Moderate risk factors correlating with standard plan
adequacy based on historical outcomes
Comprehensive Plan Triggers: High-risk activities or destinations with expensive claim
histories prompt premium tier suggestions
Personalized Coverage Advice: Customer travel profiles compared against similar historical
customers to identify optimal coverage combinations, with recommendations supported by
actual claim resolution data and customer outcome satisfaction metrics.
QUOTATION ENHANCEMENT INTEGRATION
Real-Time Recommendation Engine:
Alongside Quote Generation: During the standard quotation process, the system
simultaneously accesses MSIG's claims database to provide specific product recommendations
based on the customer's extracted travel intelligence and historical claim patterns for similar
profiles.
Evidence-Based Guidance:
●
●
●
Claim Examples: "Customers with similar Japan skiing trips average $X in medical
claims, suggesting comprehensive coverage"
Success Stories: "85% of customers with this travel profile were fully covered under our
standard plan"
Risk Mitigation: "Based on historical data, travelers to this destination typically need
enhanced medical evacuation coverage"
MCP Tool Enhancement:
Recommendation Tool Integration: Add recommendation capabilities to existing MCP
quotation tools, enabling the AI agent to provide not just pricing but specific product guidance
based on MSIG's proprietary claims experience and customer outcome data.
Contextual Advice: The system provides clear rationale for product recommendations using
MSIG's actual claims data, helping customers understand why specific coverage levels or
product tiers are suggested for their particular travel scenario.
This focused approach transforms MSIG's claims database into actionable product
recommendations during the quotation process, providing customers with data-driven coverage
guidance that competitors cannot match through their own claims experience and historical
customer outcomes.
