BLOCK 3: Document Intelligence &
Auto-Extraction & Quotation
Innovation Differentiator - The Customer Experience
Game Changer
STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE: Transform insurance quotation from manual form-filling to document
upload, automatically extracting travel details for instant personalized recommendations.
BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION IMPERATIVE
Current Challenge: Customers abandon 70% of insurance purchases due to 15-30 manual
data fields required for quotation, creating significant friction in the purchase process.
Document-First Approach: Enable customers to upload existing travel documents instead of
filling forms. Flight confirmations, hotel bookings, and itineraries already contain all quotation
data needed for accurate policy recommendations.
Competitive Advantage: MSIG becomes an intelligent "show-us-your-plans" advisor while
competitors remain dependent on traditional "fill-out-our-form" approaches that create customer
friction.
Business Impact: Reduces purchase time from 20 minutes to 2 minutes, dramatically
improving conversion rates and customer satisfaction while providing more accurate risk
assessment based on actual travel plans.
DOCUMENT TYPE PROCESSING
Flight Booking Confirmations - Primary Travel Framework: Flight documents provide the
foundation of travel intelligence with structured, reliable data including traveler details for policy
generation, trip framework with departure and arrival dates for coverage timing, and investment
indicators through ticket costs and cabin class for coverage recommendations.
Core Insight: Customers' existing travel documents contain comprehensive risk intelligence
that traditional form-based approaches cannot capture, enabling superior risk assessment and
coverage recommendations.

Cross-document Validation: Consistency verification between all uploaded documents
Data Validation & Quality Control:
Logical Consistency Checks:
●
●
●
Timeline Validation: Departure dates precede return dates with trip duration verification
Geographic Consistency: Destination cities align across flight and hotel bookings
Identity Verification: Traveler names remain consistent across all documents
●
Gap Detection: Trip timelines validate without coverage gaps or overlaps
Cross-Document Verification: Flight and hotel dates alignment with name consistency across
bookings, destination coherence verification, and inconsistency flagging for human review rather
than proceeding with potentially incorrect information.
AUTOMATED QUOTATION GENERATION
Core Process: Based on the ongoing discussion which contains travel information, previous
product recommendation (based on traveler profile), the AI agent can leverage MCP quotation
in order to propose a quote to the customer without manual intervention
Technical Flow: Product and travel discussion leads to MCP quotation tool execution. It serves
as a proposal for customers. The acceptation of this quote will lead to the Purchase step
Risk-Based Recommendations:
●
●
●
Activity Analysis: Adventure activities trigger specialized coverage suggestions
Destination Assessment: Risk assessment determines appropriate coverage limits
Investment Protection: Travel investment value calculates trip cancellation coverage
needs
●
Personalization: Recommendations based on extracted travel patterns and preferences
Real-Time Processing: Document upload to quotation generation occurs within seconds,
maintaining conversation flow without interruption while providing error handling for incomplete
extractions with specific clarification requests when needed.
This approach transforms document upload into immediate, personalized insurance
recommendations, eliminating traditional form completion friction while providing superior
coverage accuracy based on actual travel plans rather than estimated customer inputs.
